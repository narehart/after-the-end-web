Analyze this conversation for learnings that should be captured in skills.

Look for:

1. **Corrections received** - Patterns to avoid, mistakes made
2. **New patterns established** - Code style, architecture decisions, naming conventions
3. **Repeated explanations** - Things explained multiple times that could become documentation
4. **User preferences** - Specific ways the user likes things done

Review the existing skills in `.claude/skills/` and `CLAUDE.md` first, then either:

- **Update CLAUDE.md** for project-wide architecture, commands, conventions, or workflow guidance
- **Update** an existing skill if the learning fits an existing skill category
- **Create** a new skill if it's a distinct code-writing area not covered

Focus on actionable, specific guidance - not generic advice. Only make changes if there's something genuinely worth capturing.

After analyzing, summarize what you found and propose any skill updates. Ask for approval before making changes.
